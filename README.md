# resume.yaml
Write your resume in yaml and display in a nice formated page.

## Introduction

https://jsonresume.org/ is a great idea. 

Write your resume in a structured format (resume.json) 
store it in github gist like this (https://gist.github.com/thomasdavis/c9dcfa1b37dec07fb2ee7f36d7278105)
And then it can be pretty printer using your github username  like (https://registry.jsonresume.org/thomasdavis )

However I prefer to write yaml rather than json.

So this repository has a resume.yaml file with a github action gets transformed to the necesary gist.

## How to create your own resume.yaml 

- [ ] Click the Use this template button on top. To create your own repo
- [ ] Create a gist called `resume.json` in https://gist.github.com/{owner}
- [ ] Create a Personal Github token that has just the `gist` scope. Copy the value you will need it next.
- [ ] Go to your repository Settings > Secrets > Add a new secret called `TOKEN` with the value you created in the previous step.
- [ ] Verify the default values are working. Go to: https://registry.jsonresume.com/{owner} and you should see a resume with the deault values.
- [ ] Now edit the `resume.yaml` file with your own data. You can use any editor you prefer or gitpod for user friendlyness: https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/{owner}/resume
- [ ] Commit and push your changes.
- [ ] Go check [GitHub Actions](../../actions) if your modifications passed.
- [ ] Now in  https://registry.jsonresume.com/{owner} you should see your resume updated.

## How does it work?

registry.jsoneresume.com reads a gist named/resume.json and shows a nice template on top of it.

gist/resume.json is generated by github action in this repo [actions/gist.yaml](../../actions/gist.yml)

gist.yml transforms resume.yaml to temporary resume.json that is saved in the gist.
